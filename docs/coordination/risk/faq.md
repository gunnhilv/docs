## Dialogues

### Do you participate in risk assessment meetings? 

Yes. We prioritize risk assessment meetings with data controllers to assist with information and clarifications. For  DPIAs and RARs in data spaces and labs, we will be able to respond quicker if we can comment on written drafts.

## Audits

### Do you allow third-party audits? 

Yes. You may hire external companies to conduct audits of our systems and services on your behalf. 

### Do you allow technical security tests? 

Yes. You will need written approval of such testing *prior* to initiation. [Contact us](/contact) for arrangements and agreements.

## Assessments

### Do you have standardized text that we can use? 

No. You will need to make your own assessment of risks that you find relevant in your specific scientific context. When that is said, we are happy to share and discuss potential scenarios, threats and assessments.

### Can we review your internal risk assessments? 

Yes. We share our internal Risk Assessment Report (RAR) with data controllers on request. This is a summary of our current risk evaluation of organizational environments, technical environments and services environments. Data controllers are also welcome to see our full risk management assessments under some conditions. [Contact us](/contact) for such arrangements.
