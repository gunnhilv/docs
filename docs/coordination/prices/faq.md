## Compute

### Are entry machines metered? 

No. Entry machines are the machines we use to control the user management and security updates in individual labs. These are mandatory and the cost is included in lab subscription fees. You should -not- include the cost for these machines in your [price calculator](/prices/calculator/) estimates.

## Storage

### Which terabyte price will each lab pay for their storage? 

In short, each lab pay the mean terabyte price for your data space. This price to automatically incorporate your data space volume discount. For details, see the meter, cost and billing section under the Store chapter in the [services specification](/services/specifications/) and the Store section in the [price list](/prices/pricelist/), or test for yourself in the [price calculator](/prices/calculator/).
