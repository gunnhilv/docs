## Data space subscriptions

### Why is the BLUE subscription only one year? 

While both the WHITE and ORANGE subscriptions can be reserved for three years, we have kept the BLUE subscription to one year only. The reason behind this is lack of experience in pricing the additional features that are available on this level. As soon as our accuracy increase, we aim to make longer reservations available.

## Compute

### Are entry machines metered? 

No. Entry machines are the machines we use to control the user management and security updates in individual labs. These are mandatory and the cost is included in lab subscription fees. You should -not- include the cost for these machines in your [price calculator](/prices/calculator/) estimates.


## Storage

### Which terabyte price will each lab pay for their storage? 

In short, each lab pay the mean terabyte price for your data space. This price to automatically incorporate your data space volume discount. For details, see the meter, cost and billing section under the Store chapter in the [services specification](/services/specifications/) and the Store section in the [price list](/prices/pricelist/), or test for yourself in the [price calculator](/prices/calculator/). 


## Billing 

### When will you bill for the services that we consume? 

In short, you should expect the initial invoice for data space subscriptions, lab subscriptions and 1Y/3y commitments of machines and storage to be sent days of your first lab deployment. Other resources will be combined into one invoice expected to be sent quarterly. Billing details for each service is specified in the [services specification](/services/specifications/) under the "Billing" sections.
