## Compliance coordination

This section contains FAQ from compliance coordinators.

### Lab management

#### How do I add a new lab to my existing data space? 

In short, the compliance coordinator sends us a signed [lab order](/agreements/get-going/#lab-orders) and coordinate signed [user agreements](/agreements/downloads/#user-agreement) between your lab leader and your individual lab users. Head over to our [get going](/agreements/get-going/) for more information on the process.

#### How do I split one lab into two labs? 

As sciences grows inside your individual labs you may see the need to move part of this activity over to a new lab for example due to compliance issues separating data and lab users. Techically we don't split labs but add new ones. To add a new lab to your data space: 

- send us a new [lab order](/agreements/get-going/#lab-orders) and coordinate new new lab user agreements between your lab leader and individual lab users in the new lab;
- evaluate if you need to deactive some users in your original lab after the move, and if so send us a list of users you want to deactivate on [email](/contact).
- consider how you will transfer data into your new lab, for example by ordering an [internal kista](/agreements/downloads/#external-kista-import-order) from your original to your new lab.

#### How do I move a lab to another data space? 

We may transfer the ownership of a lab under your data space to another data space both inside or outside your organization. [Contact us](/contact) for such moves. We will need a lab transfer order that is co-signed by the you and affected parties.

#### How do I delete a lab? 

Labs are deleted on request of the Data space leaders and deletion requests are co-signed by Lab leaders. [Contact us](/contact) for such Lab Deletion Orders when you need to remove one of your labs. Keep in mind that all data and machines will be irrevocably destroyed in this process.

### Resources

#### If I add a new lab to my data space, how will this effect my resource consumption? 

Each new lab require dedicated storage and compute resources since data and users are separated between the environments. Related to prices, you need to plan for one lab subscription, one lab machine and at least 1 terabyte storage for each lab. 

#### Can I share resources inside my data space? 

To a certain extent. Each lab has individual allocations of compute and storage resources to keep data and use segregated for privacy and security measures. 


#### Can I share resources inside on of our labs? 

Yes. Storage and compute resources are shared among all lab users inside the same lab. This means that all lab users can access all data and all compute resources inside the same lab.
