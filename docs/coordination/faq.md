# Coordinator FAQ

This section lists frequently asked questions related to the organization of scientific activities across one to several labs inside your data space. 

::: tip

This page is intended for data space coordinators. Head over to our [Lab FAQ](/faq/) for questions related to scientific activities inside labs.

## Agreement requirements from 1. january 2022

This section contains information on the agreement updates that are required from 1. january 2022.

::: tip

Please [contact us](/contact) with your questions and concerns. We will prioritize these requests in December to the best of our effort.

:::



### Why do we need to sign new agreements? 

To ensure equal and transparent conditions for services and pricing under the new services model that starts from 1. January, we require all labs to update their agreements. 

### Which agreements do we need to sign? 

This depends on the agreement status for your organization. We require a new set of data processor agreements and new services center agreements with your organizations. When these are signed, you will need to send us your data space order and your lab order. Head over to our [get going](/agreements/get-going/) guide for a step-wise guide on each agreement type. 

### Do we need to sign all agreement layers? 

Could be. Data processor agreements and services agreements are signed on the organizational level. These are already in place for many organizations. However, if they are not in place, you will need to get them signed before you send us your data space and lab order. If they are in place, jump right into the "Data space" section in our [get going](/agreements/get-going/) guide to send us your data space order, invoice profile and lab orders. [Contact us](/contact) if you are unsure of the agreement status for your organization. 

### How do we know the agreement status of our lab? 

For December, we plan to notify lab leaders, lab coordinators and all lab users in labs with missing agreements on email as follows: (i) We will communicate the agreement status the first days in December; (ii) We will send a warning for closure in mid December; (iii) We will notify all labs that gets deactivated in January.

### Is there a deadline in December for agreement submission?

No. We aim to register agreements up until 31. December. However, please note that we will need to render your data processor agreements and services centers agreements, and such will need a few days advance. 

### What happens if we don't have all the agreements in place by 1. January? 

In short, labs that lack attachment to a data space will be temporarily deactivated until agreements are in place or a termination notification is registered. Lab users will not be able to access the lab in this period. See [Resolution 5](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/tingweek/hunt-cloud-tingweek4-resolutions.pdf#page=4) from the last Lagtun for further details (R5/LT4/T4/21).

### How will our lab be affected during a deactivation? 

In the case where access to your lab is temporarily deactivated, your access to this lab will be temporarily deactivated. Your data and your tooling will -not- be affected. All your lab machines will be running and your data will be available for analysis as soon as you submit signed agreements, and for evacuation when you submit a termination notification. See [Resolution 5](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/tingweek/hunt-cloud-tingweek4-resolutions.pdf#page=4) from the last Lagtun for further details (R5/LT4/T4/21).

### If deactivated, when can we expect our lab to be reactivated? 

We will reactivate access to labs that submit new agreements after 1. January on a running basis starting from Monday 3rd January.

### Is there a cost associated with the new agreements? 

There is no direct cost for organizations that sign Data processor agreements and Services agreements. However, note that the agreements incorporate the new [price model](/prices/introduction/) and that consumed resources will be billed to data space leaders as specified in the [services specification](/services/specifications/) in accordance with information submitted in your [invoice profile](/agreements/downloads/#invoice-profile).

### What if we would like to reduce our resources to reduce cost? 

Worry not. You may reduce resources in your lab until 1 April 2022 without cost. See [Resolution 4](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/tingweek/hunt-cloud-tingweek4-resolutions.pdf#page=3) for details, and feel free to [contact us](/contact) for dialogue on potential resource and cost optimization. 

### Can we terminate our lab? 

Yes. [Contact us](/contact) for a termination order. When the signed order is registered, we will restore access to your lab so you can prepare your data evacuation. Data will be available for evacuation until 1. April (90 days) and then destroyed (ref. [Resolution 5(e)](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/tingweek/hunt-cloud-tingweek4-resolutions.pdf#page=4)).














## Compliance coordination

This section contains FAQ from compliance coordinators.

### Lab management

#### How can we add a new lab to our existing data space? 

In short, the compliance coordinator sends us a signed [lab order](/agreements/get-going/#lab-orders) and coordinate signed [user agreements](/agreements/downloads/#user-agreement) between your lab leader and your individual lab users. Head over to our [get going](/agreements/get-going/) for more information on the process.

#### How can we split one lab into two labs? 

As science grows inside your individual labs you may see the need to move part of this activity over to a new lab for example due to compliance issues separating data and lab users. Technically we don't split labs but add new ones. To add a new lab to your data space: 

- send us a new [lab order](/agreements/get-going/#lab-orders) and coordinate new new lab user agreements between your lab leader and individual lab users in the new lab;
- evaluate if you need to deactivate some users in your original lab after the move, and if so send us a list of users you want to deactivate on [email](/contact).
- consider how you will transfer data into your new lab, for example by ordering an [internal kista](/agreements/downloads/#external-kista-import-order) from your original to your new lab.

#### How can we move a lab to a different data space? 

We may transfer the ownership of a lab under your data space to another data space both inside or outside your organization. [Contact us](/contact) for such moves. We will need a lab transfer order that is co-signed by you and affected parties.

#### How can we delete a lab? 

Lab deletions are authorized by Data space leaders and documented in a [lab deletion order](/agreements/downloads/#lab-deletion-order) that is co-signed by the affected lab leader. All data and machines in the lab will be irrevocably destroyed in this process, and neither data nor machines can be recreated.

### Resources

#### If we add a new lab to our data space, how will this affect our resource consumption? 

Each new lab requires dedicated storage and compute resources since data and users are separated between the environments. Related to prices, you need to plan for one lab subscription, one lab machine and at least 1 terabyte storage for each lab. 

#### Can we share resources inside my data space? 

To a certain extent. Each lab has individual allocations of compute and storage resources to keep data and use segregated for privacy and security measures. 


#### Can we share resources inside one of our labs? 

Yes. Storage and compute resources are shared among all lab users inside the same lab. This means that all lab users can access all data and all compute resources inside the same lab.
