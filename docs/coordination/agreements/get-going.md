## Data processor agreement

First things first, we need to get the [data processor agreement](/agreements/overview/#data-processor-agreement) in place before we are able to move the other agreement types forward. Good to know, there is no cost associated with the establishment of a data processor agreement, and we have solid templates available to for a quick process.

#### 1. Is there already a processor agreement in place between my organization and HUNT Cloud?

Ask inside your organization or [contact us](/contact) if you are unsure. Depending on your organization, data processor agreements may be signed on various organizational levels. For example, your Department will be the internal data controller at NTNU. 

If an agreement is already in place, jump to the services agreement section. If not, continue below: 

#### 2. Which agreement type do we need?

(2.1) [Data processor agreements](/agreements/overview/#data-processor-agreement): This is the "normal" type that regulates situations where you and your organization controls the data and defines the purpose of the processing.

(2.2.) [Data sub-processor agreements](/agreements/overview/#data-subprocessor-agreement): This is when the purpose of the processing is decided by an organization that is not your own, for example contract research. The organization that controls the data may add requirements for privacy and security measures that we will need to incorporate in the sub-processor agreement. 

[Contact us](/contact) us if you are unsure on the agreement type needed, approaches for joint-controller scenarios. 

#### 3. Which other agreement types outside HUNT Cloud may be required?

*Do you plan to use data from external data providers?* If you take on responsibility as the data controller, such transfers is often regulated in data export agreements or licenses that includes requirements for information security. [Contact us](/contact) us for compliance evaluations if you are unsure if specified requirements are covered in our agreements or services.

*Do you plan to onboard users from external organizations?* We encourage lab users from different organizations to meet and collaborate in labs. Access for individuals outside your organization may require data processor agreements between your host organization and the organizations of your external collaborators. Contact your local privacy officer for advice.

#### 4. Who should sign the data processor agreement? 

This is the individual that is authorized to control data on behalf of your organization. This may range from top management via head of departments to individuals in various organizational units. Ask your local privacy officer for guidance if needed.

::: tip NTNU

For NTNU, the internal "[enighetsavtaler](/agreements/overview/#agreements-within-ntnu)" is agreed with Departments with Head of Departments as signatory.

:::


#### 5. Can we use HUNT Cloud's data processor templates?

We have agreement templates that is accepted by many organizations. These agreements comply with requirements in GDPR, ISO 27001 and Norwegian health laws. Utilizing these templates are a quick way to ensure compliance with most requirements. [Contact us](/contact) for a copy that you and your your privacy officer can assess.

If our templates can be used, jump to the next section. 

If not, your organization may provide other templates as long as they adhere to the above laws, regulations and standards. Discussions between two legal teams take time, so [contact us](/contact) as soon as you can for arrangements. Jump to the services agreement section when the data processor agreement is signed.

#### 6. Forward required processor agreement information to HUNT Cloud

We need a few bits of information to prepare our agreement template:
 
- Download the "[HUNT Cloud Data Processor Agreement Form](/agreements/overview/#required-information)" on your local machine (right click on the link and select "Save Link As...")
- Open the text file in Notepad, Word or a similar application and supply the required information. Field descriptions are included in the "Clarification of the form fields" under the link above. 
- Save the text file on your local machine and attach the file to an email that you [forward to us](/contact).

::: tip NTNU

For NTNU, Signatory official is your Head of Department, Scientific contact person your Deputy Head of Department for Research, and Administrative contact the department adviser that manages your privacy agreements.

Your data processor agreement is now signed, sealed and delivered. This is a good time for a humble celebration with fresh coffee before you continue with the services agreement. 






## Services agreement

Next up is our [services agreement](/agreements/overview/#services-agreement). This agreement defines a services center and regulates how services are provided, billed and controlled. 

#### 1. Decide where your services center should be located 

There is no direct cost associated with the establishment of a services center since invoices are sent directly to data spaces for services consumed in their lab. 

However, the services center is formally responsible for cost accumulated among their attached data spaces. Therefore, services agreements needs to be signed by a formal role in your organization, such as head of centers, departments, faculties, divisions or roles in your central management. 

::: tip NTNU

For NTNU, Services centers are located at the Department level with Deputy Head of Department for Research as the center leader.

Your data space order is now signed, sealed and delivered. You are ready to add the very first lab to your data space.










## Lab orders

These are the orders that incorporates individual [labs](/agreements/overview/#lab-order) in a data space. Below is a few things that it may be good to think about as a data space and/or lab leader.

#### 1. Plan your lab portfolio

With your brand new data space in place, now is the time to recap your tactics on how to manage data and teams to provide prosperous environments in sync with your scientific vision. Digital laboratories are great at both bringing teams together and to separate activities when needed. 

*One or several labs?* 

Reasons to keep your activities together may be unity, simplicity, and cost. Reasons to segregate data and/or activities may be requirements from ethical committees and privacy officers, to limit data access between teams, data safety and reliability, separation of cost or governance, specify tools or activities, provide freedom for early-investigators on your team to develop independence and so forth. 

[Contact us ](/contact) if you think we can assist in your evaluation, and keep in mind that you can add more labs later. 

#### 2. Identify your lab team

For each lab, identify one lab leader and one lab coordinator that will manage day-to-day activities in your lab, including adding new lab users and adjusting lab resources. The lab leader and lab coordinator are our point of contact in the lab for dialogue and help, as well as the point of contact for your data space coordinator team.

#### 3. Brand your lab

For each lab, and together with your new lab team, invest some time to identify a cool, catchy or powerful name for your lab. The name of your new "scientific instrument" may help strengthen your scientific brand when you communicate with colleagues, collaborators and other interested parties. 

#### 4. Plan your lab resources

For each lab, and together with your lab team, approximate your initial requirements for storage (in terabytes) and computational power (in [machine types](/services/machine-types/)) that fits your planned experiments. Keep in mind that storage can be increased later -not decreased- and that machine types can be adjusted up and down throughout your lab's life cycle. 

For each machine type, decide if you want to commit the resource allocation for 1 year or 3 years, or if you want to utilize flexible on-demand resources as summarized in our [prices introduction](/prices/introduction), detailed in our [services specifications](/services/specifications/) and priced in our [price list](/prices/pricelist/). 

[Contact us ](/contact) for guidance on both generic and tailored setups if you think we may help. 

#### 5. Prepare your lab order

- Download the "[Lab order](/agreements/downloads/#lab-order)" on your local machine (right click on the link and select "Save Link As...")
- Open the PDF on your local machine and either (i) print and complete the fields by hand or (i) open in an PDF-editor and complete the fields digitally. Field descriptions are included in the "Clarification of the form fields" under the link above. 
- Add your own signature and the signature of the lab leader.

#### 6. Prepare your user agreements

The lab leader in each lab is responsible for the identification and verification of individual lab users that they authorize access to the lab that they manage. Such authorizations are documented in individual user agreements. Lab users need individual user agreements for each lab that they will access.

- Download the "[User agreement](/agreements/downloads/#user-agreement)" on your local machine (right click on the link and select "Save Link As...").
- Open the PDF on your local machine and either (i) print and complete the fields by hand or (i) open in an PDF-editor and complete the fields digitally. Field descriptions are included in the "Clarification of the form fields" under the link above. 
- Ensure that both the lab leader and the new user sign the agreement.

::: tip

We recommend that you onboard no more than three lab users as a start, including your technical data space coordinator, so we can ensure that both data and tools are in place as you like before the full team enters your lab.

:::

#### 7. Forward lab order and user agreements

For each lab, send us the lab order and your initial user agreements together in the same email. 

Each user will receive an email notification when we register their onboarding issue and may then proceed as in our [getting started](/getting-started/) guide. Expected time to delivery is specified on our [responsiveness](/responsiveness/) page. 

Your data lab order is now signed, sealed and delivered and ready for activation.
