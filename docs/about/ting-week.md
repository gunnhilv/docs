# Ting week

**We appoint time three times per year to meet for information, feedback and discussions on how to develop HUNT Cloud to better elevate your science. We call this gatherings Tings.** 

We arrange a layered set of Tings for various parts of our community. The meetings are spread out over one week in the winter, spring and autumn. We call these weeks "Ting weeks".

## Reports

The intent of the Ting report is to give you the opportunity to read up on **`what`** we are doing at HUNT Cloud, and a little bit on **`why`** we do it. All so we can meet at the tings and have informed discussions on how to best elevate data for a better world!

The reports include a letter with reflections from the last Ting period as well as chapters with business description, risk factors, description of properties, and external and internal controls.

## Tings

We have established the following layered Ting structure for the various parts of our community. We have appointed two hours for all Tings. The first hour is structured, and the last hour is reserved for unstructured discussion.


### Lagtun

Lagtun is the Ting where we meet data controllers and data space leaders from the BLUE subscription layer to discuss the overall strategic direction for data-driven science in general and the tactical adaptation of those strategies in HUNT Cloud.


### Lab ting

This is our **`allting`** where all lab users meet for information, feedback and discussion on our lab services, such as storage, compute, transfers, software, documentation, communication etc.

### Coordinator ting

This Ting gather coordinators from services centers, data spaces and labs. The discussons focuses on scientific coordination, including agreements and compliance, user and resource management, knowledge transfers, data management and financial aspects of the services etc.

### Enterprise ting

The Enterprise ting intend to gather data controllers and lab users from small and medium private enterprises (SMEs) to discuss how to best elevate private data-driven activities and innovations.







## Invitations 

Invitations to the Tings are derived from registered roles in contractual agreements with HUNT Cloud:

- **`Lab ting`**: Lab users with a signed user agreement and active VPN connection. 
- **`Coordinator ting`**: Individuals listed as "coordinators" in data controller, data space or lab agreements. 
- **`Enterprise ting`**: Users and coordinators registered or associated with private enterprises. 
- **`Lagtun`**: Signatory officials and scientific contacts on data controller agreements and data space leaders on the BLUE data space subscription layer.

## FAQ

### Why Tings? 

The inspiration to appoint time to meet at regular intervals in a layered structure is drawn from the Old Norse [ting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_(assembly)#Etymology) structures such as [Frostating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostating) here in Trøndelag. The intention is to ensure regular discussions on how we together best can elevate data for a better world, including feedback on how to best adapt and evolve the scientific toolbox of HUNT Cloud to better support your scientific journey.

### Is this an assembly? 

No. Our tings are not the same as a general assembly (generalforsamling) with binding decisions. As of today, our tings are to be seen as a gathering of people that both champion and dream up ideas on how to best utilize data for a better world. HUNT Cloud is owned by NTNU which has the full financial and compliance responsibilities for our services.

### How do I get invited? 

Ting invitations, agenda and digital meeting links are forwarded on email a few weeks before the Ting week. Dates will also be announced on these pages and on Slack.

### Where do we meet? 

We will meet digitally at Zoom utilizing the NTNU subscription. Links will be forwarded on email and on Slack for the lab ting.

### Where are the minutes? 

Our tings have public agendas and internal minutes. We write up a summary after the week that gets distributed directly to the invited parties. The summary contains statements from all tings.

### What does the word Lagtun mean? 

We know, we know. Lagtun is hard to pronounce in english. However, in Norwegian it is a word with several meanings that we think capture the soul of our top level ting. 

First, **`Lag`** means "law" In Old Norse. This meaning is included in the last part of the name of our region, Trøndelag, which means the law of the Trønders. In addition, "lag" means "team" in modern Norwegian, reflecting the collaborative nature of the ting. 

The second part, **`tun`** is also an Old Norse word for a fenced in area, usually around a collection of farm houses, much like your fenced in lab machines. Also relevant, the old tings were held on fenced in tuns for which the the Vikings had to leave all weapons by the fence before they entered the ting.
