# Lagtun

**Lagtun is the body that appoints time for the scientific governance of HUNT Cloud. Data controllers, services centers and large data spaces meet to give recommendations expressed as resolutions on our scientific development.**

## About

High impact science needs continuous developments in data, tools, expertise and environments to prosper. 

We source the cooperative problem solving and joint strategic thinking among our members to ensure continuous movement of our activities. 

Lagtun is the body that govern our scientific development. The body meets to give recommendations on our scientific development directly to the Director of HUNT Research Centre. 

Recommendations through resolution was introduced in Lagtun #4 (2021-10). 


## Membership

The following Lagtun membership tickets are issued to contracting parties from public and non-profit organizations:

* One ticket per Data controller with at least one active data space.
* One ticket per Service center with at least one active data space. 
* One ticket per Data space on the BLUE subscription level.

The membership criteria was clarified in [R6/LT/T4/21](https://assets.hdc.ntnu.no/assets/tingweek/hunt-cloud-tingweek4-resolutions.pdf#page=5).






## Resolutions

Lagtun gives recommendations on our development in the form of resolutions. 

[Click here to read the resolutions >>](/tingweek/resolutions) 


### Consideration

HUNT Research Centre and NTNU are legally responsible for our activities, including aspects related to privacy, security and finance. Changes to our activities needs to be approved by the Director of HUNT Research Centre. 

The resolutions are therefore expressed as recommendations for consideration to the Director of HUNT Research Centre. The Director of HUNT Research Centre may: (i) adopt the resolution, meaning that HUNT Cloud will incorporate the recommendations directly; or (ii) take the resolution into consideration, meaning that we need more time to investigation options before decisions on further actions.

### Consensus

We aim to reach consensus for the resolutions in Lagtun. This means that all members agree to recommend the resolution without taking a vote.

When we adopt resolutions by consensus, we have to be concerned about the viewpoint of everyone. This means that we have to engage in multilateral dialogues and negotiations, and different points of view needs be taken into consideration. We feel that such a process is inclusive. 

### Voting

When a vote is needed to pass a resolution, each member of Lagtun has one vote. Decisions are made by simple majority. 

### Construction

Resolutions consist of two parts: (i) the introductory sentence that states the context of the resolution, and (ii) one to several operational clauses that describe the recommended action. 

### Numbering

Resolutions are numbered as follows: item on the agenda, Lagtun meeting number, Ting week number and year. To illustrate, resolution **`R6/LT4/T4/21`** means that this was the resolution from item 6 on the agenda in the fourth Lagtun during the fourth Ting week held in 2021. 

Operational clauses inside a resolution are numbered with the item number and letters in alphabetical order. For example, **`6(a)`** means that this is the first operational clause of item 6 in this Lagtun.







## Agenda

After each Tingweek, we start to identify and allocate new topics for consideration on the next Lagtun. Items are typically items identified through dialogues with the community and our cloud team.

All users are welcome to propose agenda items for the next meeting through their representatives. You can find the representative list in the [resolution document](/tingweek/resolutions), or you may [contact us](/contact/) if you need help identifying your Lagtun representative. 

Items will be floated to members of Lagtun, and one or more resolutions will be added on the topic based on discussions and negotiations. A draft resolution will be tabled in the agenda. 

The aim is to float items to member representatives **30 days** before the meeting with the possibility to adjust and propose new resolutions, and to table the draft resolutions with introduction and operational clauses at the latest **10 days** before the meeting.




## Schedule

Lagtun is scheduled on Thursdays between 9-11 am CET during the Ting weeks. Click here to see [upcoming dates](/tingweek/#dates-and-agendas).



## Records

We document meeting records in addition to the public resolutions. These includes backgrounds, draft resolutions, dialogues and discussions, the final resolutions and considerations. Advices given during the meeting are recorded as "recommendations". The records are distributed to all active HUNT Cloud users. 




## Name

We know, Lagtun is difficult to pronounce in english. However, in Norwegian it is a word with several meanings that we think capture the soul of this Ting. 

First, **Lag** means "law" In Old Norse. This meaning is included in the last part of the name of our region, Trøndelag, which means the law of the Trønders. In addition, "lag" means "team" in modern Norwegian, reflecting the collaborative nature of the ting. 

The second part, **tun** is also an Old Norse word for a fenced in area, usually around a collection of farm houses, much like your fenced in lab machines. Also relevant, the old tings were held on fenced in tuns for which the the Vikings had to leave all weapons by the fence before they entered the ting.
